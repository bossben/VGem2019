      <h2 id = "plastic-waste"> Plastic waste is choking the environment</h2>
      <p>Petroleum based plastics wreak havoc on environments worldwide. Every year, over 25 million tons of plastics are disposed of into landfills.<sup>1</sup> At current production rates of 300 million tons per year, it is estimated only 53.3 years of economic oil extraction remain<sup>2,3</sup> Polystyrene, commonly known as Styrofoam, accounts for over 30 percent of this total plastic waste in volume.<sup>4</sup> This leaves a pressing need to find both a biodegradable alternative to plastics and a method to reduce polystyrene.</p>
      <h2 id = "polystyrene-degrading"> Polystyrene cannot be efficiently degraded </h2>
      <p> Recycling plastics is usually not profitable and this inhibits the recycling capacity of many centers. Styrofoam is particularly unprofitable as recyclables are calculated on a "per pound" basis and the composition expanded polystyrene is roughly 95% air. Additionally, many local recycling plants are incapable of properly recycling polystyrene, as the process of compression requires expensive machinery and copious energy. Instead, the job is outsourced to a large industrial plant, which increases transportation costs. Because of this, companies offload polystyrene to landfills where it accumulates in large volumes.<sup>6</sup> In the United States alone, about 3 million pounds of polystyrene are put into landfills each day. At a disposal cost of $1.5/lb, companies in the United States invest a total of ~4 million dollars a day for polystyrene disposal.<sup>5</sup></p>
      <h2 id = "PHAs-future"> PHAs are the future of plastics </h2>
      <p> In recent years, the effect of single use plastics on the environment has become a pressing issue at the forefront of global attention. However, while it is promising to see the world slowly move to a greener future, current movements such as banning straws or plastic bags do not eliminate the need for single use plastic.<sup>7</sup> Enter PHAs!  Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a group of bacterial polyesters that function as biodegradable plastics. PHAs are produced by a variety of prokaryotic microorganisms under unbalanced nutrition conditions. The main obstacle to PHAs becoming a viable alternative to normal plastic is the high cost of the carbon substrate, typically glucose, which accounts for up to 50% of the total production cost. The production of PHAs with waste carbon sources has been identified as a viable means to significantly reduce the cost. Our project aims to demonstrate that waste polystyrene can effectively be used as a carbon source for PHA production.</p>
      <h2 id = "solution"> Solution: Remediate polystyrene while producing PHAs at the same time</h2>
      <p> By introducing genes for the sty and pha pathways to E. coli, styrene (the monomer of polystyrene) can be metabolized by the bacteria to produce P3HB. The sty plasmid includes genes styABCDE, which were taken from Pseudomonas putida. This will take styrene as an input and convert it to phenyl acetic acid. Next, phenyl acetic acid will be converted to acetyl-coA through the native paa pathway, which is expressed in our chassis organism E.coli TG1. Lastly the acetyl-coA is used to produce our desired output, P3HB. This process is facilitated by the pha plasmid containing genes phaABC from Cuprividas Necator. Coupling the need for a cost-effective method to process polystyrene waste and sustainably produce PHAs creates a niche market in which two problems can be solved with a single solution.</p>
      <h2 id = "society"> Transfoam in Society</h2>
      <p>When creating a biological device, it is of utmost importance to understand its social impact on the world. Our project has the potential to disrupt the styrene life-cycle so we wanted to understand how polystyrene is currently managed and how our project would impact its management on the local and industrial scale. We visited our local recycling plants and engaged in dialogue with local sustainability groups to discuss how our project will interact with the already established efforts to reduce plastic waste.</p>
