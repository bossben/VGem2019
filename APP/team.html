She will write more here, who knows what she will write. In the meantime, I am typing random words to fill up the space. What is the longest word possible? It probably isn't supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, since that word is made up, and featured primarily in the hit musical Mary Poppins. Speaking of which, Simonne is a huge fan of Hamilton. This should have filled up sufficient space. Not quite yet, okay then. Here we go. Blah blah blah. Jermaine said I should fill it up more doot doot. Remember the name. Random words. Anteater. Why are highlighters called Sharpies? Probably because Sharpie is one of those words that is actually the name of a company. The same is true of Ping Pong. What else? Kleenex. Jacuzzi. All of these. Weird. Just 1 more line to go! Woohoo, done. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </p>
